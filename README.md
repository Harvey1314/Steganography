# Steganography

Steganography is the art of hiding the fact that communication is taking place, by hiding information in other information. Many different carrier file formats can be used, but digital images are the most popular because of their frequency on the internet. For hiding secret information in images, there exists a large variety of steganography techniques some are more complex than others and all of them have respective strong and weak points. Different applications may require absolute invisibility of the secret information, while others require a large secret message to be hidden. This project report intends to give an overview of image steganography, its uses and techniques. It also attempts to identify the requirements of a good steganography algorithm and briefly reflects on which steganographic techniques are more suitable for which applications.

Steganography  become  more  important  as  more  people  join  the  cyberspace revolution.  Steganography  is  the  art  of  concealing  information  in  ways  that prevents the detection of hidden messages. Stegranography include an array of secret communication methods  that  hide  the  message  from  being  seen  or  discovered.
